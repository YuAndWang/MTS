## Highlights
* MTS Dataset: Carefully selected observations from 160 images covering different years and regions, optimized for cross-domain analysis at the maize tasseling stage.
* RFS Module: Enhances deep semantic information perception by stacking multiple convolutional operations with varying dilation rates, effectively expanding the receptive field.
* Accurate-Context Occlusion: A clever occlusion simulation method that takes full contextual information within images into account for more accurate results.
* TasselLFANetâ€ : An automated observation method with robustness and domain adaptation, demonstrating a remarkable 100% accuracy in automated tasseling stage observation.
